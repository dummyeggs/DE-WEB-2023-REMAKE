Today I got my order plus so much more.  I want to thank you so much for   all the extra eggs you sent along.  As a non-profit, it can be hard to   make our dollars stretch to do everything we need to do for the   well-being of our birds.  Having you send along such a large assortment   of all size eggs is incredibly generous.  I want you to know we really,   really appreciate it.  I will be sending a note to our corporate   donation folks, so you can get the credit you deserve. Sincerely, thank you!&#8221;

We generally have so few egg laying issues, but the changes in weather and humidity in CO this summer have triggered some reproductive behaviors. We certainly don't want to add to the flock that we care for, and we generally shake the eggs, date them and replace them under the bird. But, in a couple of cases, this was not successful with the doves and a pigeon, and we don't want that to happen again. We've recently gotten in a large number of finches and budgies too, and all of them are the offspring of persons who started out with two... essentially multiplying the problem that they relinquish. Many thanks for helping us out.<em>&#8221;</em></h4>

My bird only lays a couple every few years,  and this time I hard boiled them to prevent breakage, but they got chipped  anyway. So now I don&rsquo;t have to do that anymore. These are just perfect, and I&rsquo;m  so glad to have these, you just don&rsquo;t know. Can&rsquo;t thank you enough. &#8212;<em> Thomasina</em></h4>

I put them in, she ignored them, I took them out for awhile, put them back in and she accepted them the second time. No screaming , biting , hormone temperament! But mostly no calcium deficiency to worry about. Theses are such a blessing. Thank you. I will be posting in cockatoo forums and groups about these.   &#8212; <em>Pam</em></h4>

I followed the directions to a tee, putting a nesting bowl in the nesting box with all 7 eggs as soon as I saw she was laying. My ‘keet girl even laid an extra and I removed it right away. BTW there’s a boy in the cage so I’m pretty sure they would have hatched if I left the real ones in there. After she laid the one egg, she sat on the fake ones for about a month. Then one day, she lost interest, came out of the nesting box, and is happily again in the cage chittering away!

                <h4 class="Astyle114SERIFleft">Hi, Melanie - Just thought you'd like to know -- I've used your dummy eggs twice now (two separate breeding seasons) for my macaw.  When she started displaying nesting behavior last November, I cleaned her cage and while she was sitting on a perch outside her cage watching me, I slipped the dummy eggs into her cage in about the same place where she had put them the first time.  Almost immediately, she went into full-on nesting mode and settled down on the eggs.  She never laid any of her own but guarded the dummy eggs like a hawk, and when I pulled the dummy eggs a few weeks later, she acted a little confused at first, but after a few hours, she got the idea and was back to normal.  Next season when she starts the nesting behavior, I'll put the eggs in a little sooner than I did this time, hopefully to head off the nesting behavior entirely. Thanks for a great product -- and congratulations on 10 years! - Toni

So happy. - <em>Gary</em></h4>

She laid on her fake eggs until about two weeks ago when she left them, but I left them in her nest box. Now she has returned to them miraculously. I took her to the vet today to see if she perhaps had another one of her own eggs stuck inside her, but she didn't. He and I decided that she must think she had already laid her eggs.
                  <em><strong>I took your fake eggs with me to her avian vet, and he absolutely raved about them. He's been a vet for over 40 years and he said he's never seen anything like it.  I heard him calling his assistant to come look at your website! </strong></em><strong></strong>

They came late yesterday &amp; this morning were put into   the birds' cage. <em><strong>By the time we left the room, both Saffron &amp;   Rainbow were happily sitting in the nest bowl.</strong></em>  Love the rounded corner   square shape instead of a round bowl &amp; there is plenty of room for   the two of them without having to feel crowded.  Saffron had become   critically ill a year ago due to chronic egg laying over a period of   several months &amp; it took a long time for her to recover.  Having   these dummy eggs should help them both avoid that in the future.

                <h4 class="Astyle114SERIFleft">Hi Melanie, Thought I'd let you know that I have got the eggs
                  Immediately they <em><strong>have been worth their weight in gold! </strong></em>My 2yr old pair of Major Mitchel's layed; so I  put 1 of your medium eggs in,
                  exactly the same size by the way. <em><strong>Took the real egg out worth $4500, and put in my incubator.</strong></em> Next day checked the nest box and they had chewed the fake egg instead of destroying their real egg.
                  So they have already payed for themselves. I have put 2 more eggs in so there are 3 fake eggs in the nestbox.
                  Hopefully when the hen lays again the real egg will get lost among  the fake eggs. &#8212; Ronald, Pacific Aviaries Ltd. NZ

            My nine budgie-sized eggs arrived yesterday and just in time.  I’m an exhibition breeder just getting back into the fancy after a 20 year hiatus. I don’t use the dummy eggs to limit hens laying – although I do know that that technique can work – but rather I use them as “insurance” in some of my nests.  In particular, some hens sit very “tight” and, if they only have one or two chicks and nothing else, this can lead to spraddled legs or suffocated chicks.  So, I use the dummy eggs as “jack stands” for the hen so the chicks don’t get squashed. Right now, I have one foster pair with two chicks that hatched last evening.  There was only one old infertile egg left in the nest and I was concerned that it would eventually get tossed or broken.  I pulled it out and replaced with two dummy eggs.  The hen accepted the new eggs with no problems.  I’ll remove them one-for-one as I put more eggs in the nest a day or two prior to the hatch dates.  By then, the older chicks will then provide the space the hatchlings will need.
                <p>Thanks for the quick service and decent products. &#8212; Bob K</p>

                <h4 class="Astyle114SERIFleft">First off let me thank you so very much for all that you do. My little girl (cockatiel), Mooky, hasn't laid an egg in over a year because of your dummy eggs. After being told by our vet that all we could do was supplement her with calcium and minimize brooding potential we almost conceded to the fact that she would just continue to suffer as a chronic egg layer. Then I stumbled on you! I'm so grateful that we found you and all the information you provide. It really is very informative.

				<h4 class="Astyle114SERIFleft">Hey Mel, I just wanted to drop a line and let you guys know, you have helped a lost foundling. She was found, extremely weak, at a parking garage in Rochester. We took her to our avian vet (we live with 5 rescue birds, all much larger than the little cockatiel we ordered on behalf of, and all of them are males), and a few weeks later, she's not only doing better, she started laying eggs! Enter panic mode for me... waaaay inexperienced with hen-cockatiel. I combed every website I could find for help. Yours was very informative, helpful, and the eggs came quickly! She also took to them immediately! Thank you for your help, and excellent advice...she's not going to be bred, but going to a home that will understand her and love her. Thank you again!  &#8212; Christine </h4>

                  Thank you for remembering my TATA. She responded well to those eggs and sit   on them like they were hers. We believe they helped her lay less as she was an   old bird. 
                  We had her  for 12 yrs and she was full grown when we got her. When we first got her and she looked at me   from the cage  I saw a look of love in her eye. I reached in and she   climbed to my shoulder and stayed there for 12yrs. Needless to say I loved her   and she loved me. NICE NEW WEBSITE!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!

When I see an   egg at the bottom of the cage, I take it out and put in 4 of the dummy   eggs. That is how many my girl typically   lays before settling in for the hatch. It keeps her from over producing   eggs that tax her system.<em><strong> And neither TJ or Lily know the difference.   Thanks again for your great eggs! </strong></em><strong></strong></h4>

First of all, they were the EXACT size! We simply went about our normal daily bottom of the cage cleaning routine and did a quick swap. Even under the most watchful eye of the new mama bird, the exchange happened and she swooped back down and nestled right on her little egg. We are only using one at this time and it has been fantastic. Since she is 26 and this is her first egg (mind you we thought <em><strong>we had a boy for the past 26 years!!</strong></em>). I can't thank you enough for this fantastic product! Not only do we love it, but our little girl Chickie is just adapting beautifully to it!!
